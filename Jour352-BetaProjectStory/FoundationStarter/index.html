<p>Many University of Maryland students say they are concerned about their safety on campus because of an increase in crimes on and around campus.
<br><br>
There have been 13 robberies, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/09/29/vehicle-parts-stolen-college-park-wheels/"> 8 auto part thefts,</a> and 3 carjackings since January, according to UMD Alerts. There have also been 2 attempted carjackings.
<br><br>
“I’ve been getting a lot of messages about…incidents happening on the campus as well as outside of campus, about like armed robberies, and vehicles getting broken into,” said Jasper Le, a graduate student.

Robberies are up 550% since last year and the number of carjackings has trippled.
“[The increase in crime] is definitely a concern and it's kind of unfortunate that it’s happening to a school, especially here like I wouldn’t expect it to happen”, said freshman Nayan Flood.

<h2>Targets of Opportunities</h2>
<br>
Most buildings are open to the public during normal business hours. Places like McKeldin Library, Adele H. Stamp Student Union, and parking garages are becoming hotspots for these types of crimes. 
<br><br>
“We are a public institution. We want everyone to come here, but because of that everyone does like to come to our campus,” said Lieutenant Rossane Hoaas, University of Maryland Police Department’s Public Information Officer. <br><br><h3>“There are people that like to come here because they want to take advantage of the people who aren’t paying attention to things, to their property.”</h3>
<br><br>

<br><br>
UMD has over 500 cameras on campus that are monitored on a daily basis, added Lieutenant Hoaas. UMPD currently has about 80 sworn officers and about 150 civilian staff including dispatchers, security operations personnel, building security, and student police auxiliary.
<br><br>
All campus police officers are assigned to patrol different areas of the campus, so they are more likely to familiarize themselves with the people they serve and take pride in protecting their areas.
<br><br>
“As a community, we all play a role. The police do their job, but the community helps by sharing information and tips. It’s a joint effort,” said Lieutenant Hoaas.
<br><br>
<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
UMPD advises staying vigilant and using the walking escort service if feeling unsafe when walking on or near campus. If you would like a walking escort, call 301-405-3555 to request one. People can also use blue light emergency phones to call for an escort. 
<br><br>
The police department also encourages everyone to say something if they see something. People can submit anonymous tips by calling 301-405-3555 or visiting 
<a href="https://www.umpd.umd.edu/contact/submit_tip.cfm"> UMPD’s website.</a>
