<h1> Navient Facing Lawusit for Misleading Student Borrowers </h1>
<h3> <em> By: Mariam Bukhari </em> </h3>
<br><br>
<p> Navient is facing a lawsuit for misleading students borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The student loan company is accused of not giving borrowers enough information to understand how to repay their loans. This has caused confusion and may have made it more expensive for borrowers. They are also accused of not telling borrowers about options like income-driven repayment plans that could have made loan management easier. This added to the stress many students were facing as they tried to adjust to remote learing and job losses. </p>
