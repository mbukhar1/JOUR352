<h3>Historic Changes</h3>
<p>UMD has a legitimate nightlife scene, students go to bars and restaurants on and around campus to meet new people and spend time with the people they care about, but Of the 5 bars near UMD’s campus, Looneys, Turf, Cornerstone, Town Hall and RJ Bentleys, only Town Hall and RJ Bentleys were there in 1987 (cornerstone replaced a bar called the rendezvous in 1997), and nightlife during the 80’s was much more benign than it is now. UMD had roughly 38,000 students in 1987, compared to about 40,000 in 2023, but according to our professor, UMD was “much more of a commuter school back then” and the added number of students living on campus has caused the night scene to explode. A more pronounced nightlife scene would, in theory, raise crime rates, but a paltry 10% clearance rate from the police means that you could get away with crimes very often back then.

Many students are worried about the purple line increasing crime and general nuisances from around PG County, but most current students will be graduated by then. The construction and potholes and garbage on route one is the soul of the road, but UMD students make due, and always go out looking to have a good time. UMD staples like Marathon Deli, Blaze Pizza and CP liquors may not be the nicest institutions in the world, but damn do we love them like family.
<br>
We here at UMD love our big school, and while it might not be the safest, or the best at sports, or the nicest looking, or the smartest, or the most fun, or the easiest to walk around, or the easiest to drive through or… whatever. We love it. It’s part of who we are, and nobody can ever take that away from us.

If you come to UMD looking for a fun nightlife scene you will find it. Route one connects the campus in such a way that wherever you want to go, it’s probably on the same street, so you’re likely to find a friend just wandering around. You could just see a classmate at the bar one night, a connection you would never have with someone you talked to once in a group project, but you’re both people and you can say hi and get to know them in the bustling world of College Park, outside of the confines of a classroom. 
<br>

Lots of state schools are “house party” schools, but the nightlife scene in college park means that you don’t need to be in a fraternity or sorority, or know someone with a house to have a good time going out on the weekends. And that community is what makes the University of Maryland, UMD. We win together, we lose together, we drink together, we eat together, and no matter what, through all its flaws, UMD and route one turn the 40,000 students at this university into terps.
