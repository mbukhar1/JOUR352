<h2> Changes</h2>
<p>The upcoming winter is shaping up to be much different than last winter, especially across the central and eastern United States, and AccuWeather forecasters say one month may leave the biggest impression.
<br><br>
"February can be an active and intense month," AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist and veteran forecaster Paul Pastelok said.
<br><br>
One of the driving forces this winter will be the strengthening El NiÃ±o, which will play a significant role in the weather across the United States throughout the entire winter season. The pattern is marked by warmer-than-normal waters in parts of the tropical Pacific Ocean, a counterpart to La
NiÃ±a, which has ruled for the past three winters.
AccuWeather forecasters explain everything you need to know about the
impending cold, snowy weather and what the major pattern shift means for
the season ahead in a complete region-by-region breakdown of the 2023-2024
winter forecast.

A map shows the temperature departures from historical average across the U.S. Temperatures will be above the historical averages across many northern areas of the United States this winter. There will be pockets with below-average temperatures in the Southwest and Southern states.

There will be pockets with below-average temperatures in the Southwest and Southern states.
<br><br>
<h3>"El NiÃ±o is upon us," Pastelok said. "It came on strong here in late summer, and it will continue to be strong and a dominating factor going into our winter forecast."</h3>
<br><br>
<h2>What is El NiÃ±o?</h2>
El NiÃ±o is a regular, large-scale climate phenomenon that occurs when the
water temperatures near the equator of the central and eastern Pacific
Ocean are above the historical average for months at a time. The change in
water temperatures reshapes the jet stream and, ultimately, weather
patterns in various parts of the world -- including North America.
<br><br>
The influence El NiÃ±o has on the weather is amplified during the winter
months, especially when El NiÃ±o is strong, like what is anticipated this
winter.
<br><br>
However, Pastelok warns that every El NiÃ±o is different and that the
weather patterns this winter may vary from recent winters when El NiÃ±o
was present.
<br><br>
This winter's weather in the Northeast is expected to be much different
than last winter across most of New England and the mid-Atlantic.
<br><br>
Some of the first snowfall accumulations of the season are typically
linked to the effect of lakes when cold air blows over the comparatively
warm waters of the Great Lakes to produce snow. Two bursts of prolific
lake-effect snow pummeled Buffalo, New York, during the first part of the
winter season last year. The first took place in mid-November and unloaded
up to 6 feet of snow and was followed by a deadly lake-effect blizzard
just days before Christmas.
<br><br>
<h2>What to Expect?</h2>
"We're not expecting what we saw last year," Pastelok said. Still, folks
who live downwind of the Great Lakes should still prepare for bouts of
lake-effect snow from late autumn through the start of 2024.
<br><br>
While Buffalo may not receive as much snow as it did last winter, the
millions of people who live along the Interstate 95 corridor are predicted
to see more powder than they did during the 2022-2023 season.
<br><br>
The window for snow-producing nor'easters will open in late January
through February which could dish out hefty snowfall amounts to Boston,
New York City, Philadelphia and beyond. "That will be our best opportunity
to see some of these big Northeast systems," Pastelok said.
<br><br>
An early-season nor'easter can't be ruled out either as the ingredients
for a snowstorm may come together sometime in November.
<br><br>
Last winter, Boston received only 12.4 inches of snow, New York City
measured only 2.3 inches, and a snow shovel wasn't even needed in
Philadelphia, where just 0.3 of an inch accumulated throughout the
entirety of the winter. Much higher snowfall amounts are predicted this
year, with AccuWeather long-range meteorologists forecasting 38-44 inches
in Boston, 18-26 inches in New York City and 16-24 inches in Philadelphia
-- all around the historical average.

<br><br>
The uptick in snowfall will benefit skiers and snowboarders across the
region. There may be some lulls in the snow season that could result in
short-term setbacks for ski resorts, but a stormy end to the winter will
help to prolong the ski season across the Appalachians.
<h2>El NiÃ±o in the Southeast</h2>
<br><br>
A tumultuous weather pattern may unfold over the Southeast this winter,
AccuWeather forecasters warn.
<br><br>
"El NiÃ±o tends to favor severe weather in Florida and the Gulf Coast
states," Pastelok said.
<br><br>
In addition to El NiÃ±o, water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico continue
to run above the historical average. These two factors will create the
"perfect setup" for severe weather and tornadoes across the Gulf Coast
during the winter, Pastelok explained.
<br><br>
Multiple severe weather outbreaks swept across the region during the first
part of 2016 amid a strong El NiÃ±o, including a tornado outbreak in
Florida on Jan. 17 and a more widespread severe weather event along the
Gulf Coast on Feb 23. By the end of February, the number of tornado
reports across the U.S. was above the historical average due to severe
weather events across the Southeast.

<br><br>
In between the spells of severe weather will be the opportunity for chilly
air to make its way as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.
<br><br>
January and February are projected to be much colder across the Southeast
when compared to last winter. The result will be a higher heating demand,
including in Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas and Houston.
<br><br>
The lower temperatures may also be accompanied by the chance of snow and
ice across part of the Southeast. Pastelok said that the highest risk for
wintry precipitation will be across the Tennessee Valley and the northern
extent of the Gulf Coast states. The chance of damaging winter storms will
be lower in Texas, but the state could still get one or two storms
throughout the season that feature wintry precipitation.
<br><br>
Last winter was one of the snowiest in recent history across the Midwest,
a boon for ski resorts across the region as snow frequented the region
throughout the season. Minneapolis measured 90.3 inches of snow, the
third-snowiest winter in the city since record-keeping began in the 1870s.
<br><br>
This winter is not expected to be a repeat of last year with the seasonal
snowfall totals forecast to be less than half of the totals from last
year.
<br><br>
The less frequent snowfall will be accompanied by fewer cold waves,
especially during the first part of the winter.
<br><br>
"December should be mild overall across the Midwest and Great Lakes with
just a couple of brief, chilly periods," Pastelok explained. This pattern
will carry over into the start of 2024, but the season could take a
blustery turn during the second half of winter.
<br><br>
<h2>El NiÃ±o in the Northern Plains and Midwest</h2>
A shift in the polar vortex could open up the gates of the Arctic to
unleash frigid air across the central and midwestern U.S. late in the
winter, resulting in some of the coldest conditions of the season.
<br><br>
The tumbling temperatures will make energy bills noticeably higher than in
the first half of the winter season. Even with the late-season intrusions
of Arctic air taken into account, the overall energy demand for the season
across the northern Plains and Midwest is predicted to be near to below
the historical average.
<br><br>
If the Great Lakes remain primarily ice-free during the first half of the
winter, blasts of bitterly cold air later in the winter could trigger some
spells of lake-effect snow.
<br><br>
Farther south, snowfall is forecast to be closer to slightly above the
long-term historical averages.
<br><br>
Last winter, Kansas City measured only 8.8 inches of snow, less than half
of the typical snowfall totals for an entire winter. This year,
AccuWeather meteorologists say that between 12 and 20 inches will
accumulate in the city.
<br><br>
Seasonal snowfall totals may exceed the historical average in Denver,
where 49.4 inches is the historical average for the entire season.
AccuWeather is projecting a seasonal accumulation of 50 to 60 inches this
winter.
<br><br>
Any precipitation that falls across the central U.S. will help to boost
water levels on the Mississippi River, which are near all-time record lows
for the second consecutive year. Pastelok said that water levels across
the waterway will likely remain low throughout winter before levels return
closer to the historical average.
<br><br>
Last winter was one for the history books in California as an onslaught of
atmospheric rivers dumped monumental snowfall in the mountains that helped
ski resorts remain open until July and flooding rainfall that filled many
water reservoirs across the region.
<br><br>
A repeat is possible this winter across California, Nevada and the Four
Corners region, which includes Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, due
to the anticipated weather patterns shaped by El NiÃ±o. Most El NiÃ±os
typically result in a stormy pattern over California with frequent rain
and mountain snow, while storms largely miss the Pacific Northwest.
<br><br>
The upcoming season does look like it will follow the traditional El NiÃ±o
pattern with the jet stream directing storms into California, Nevada and
the Four Corners. This differs from the El NiÃ±o of 2015-2016 when storms
largely avoided California. Pastelok added that cooler waters southeast of
Hawaii could cause the storm track this winter to focus on areas south of
Southern California occasionally.
<br><br>
The projected storm track will also send storms over the Four Corners and
central and southern Rockies.
<br><br>
Excellent ski conditions are expected in Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New
Mexico for the second year in a row; however, snowfall totals may not
reach the benchmarks from last season.
<br><br>
The storm track will help to fill water reservoirs that remain below
historical averages due to years of drought, including Lake Mead and Lake
Powell.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the predominant storm track is expected to stay south of the
Northwest during the heart of the winter season. Some storms may side-
swipe areas along and west of Interstate 5 in Washington and Oregon, but
the bulk of the rain and mountain snow will miss the Cascades and northern
Rockies.
<br><br>
Drought conditions have progressively worsened across Washington and
Oregon since the start of the summer, according to the U.S. Drought
Monitor. With the most significant winter storms likely missing the
region, the drought may expand and worsen through the first part of 2024.
<br><br>
"In the United States, our AccuWeather long-range forecast prediction is
for it to be colder this winter than it was last year, with temperatures
closer to normal," AccuWeather Founder & Executive Chairman Dr. Joel N.
Myers said. "We expect to see an increase in U.S. demand for heating
overall compared to last year, even though many places in the North will
still average below historical demand."
<br><br>
For instance, in New York, heating degree days are predicted to be 4%
below the historical average, compared to 15% below last year, which is an
11-12% increase over last year. A similar story will unfold in Boston and
the rest of New England.
<br><br>
"The Southern states, including Texas, will also see an increase in
percentages of heating degree days (HDD) and perhaps may even exceed
historically normal energy demands this year," Myers said.
